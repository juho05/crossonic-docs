enables/disables features based on availability.

If the app is not available on a platform or if you just prefer a different app you can connect any
(Open)Subsonic compatible client to the server and all of your playlists/hearts/etc. will be synced.

[^1]: There are currently no release builds available for iOS because I do not have a paid Apple Developer account.
[^2]: The web version of Crossonic has some features disabled and generally has poor performance. Browser support varies.
