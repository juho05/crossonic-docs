title: Hosting a web client
---

Crossonic-Server supports hosting a web client. It allows a client such as the [web version of Crossonic](/app/platforms/web) to be reachable
on the same URL as the server.

## Client support

I have only tested this feature with Crossonic Web but it should work with all web based clients that only require static files to be hosted.

This page only discusses setting up Crossonic Web but the instructions should be easily transferable to other clients.

## Hosting Crossonic Web

*Disclaimer: Crossonic Web is a limited version of [Crossonic](/app) that runs in a browser. Depending on the browser the performance can be
quite terrible and support for different media formats and transcoded playback varies substantially between browsers.*

Begin by entering the directory of you `docker-compose.yml` file and creating a directory for the client files.

```bash
cd ~/crossonic-server
mkdir frontend
```

Next download the latest version of Crossonic Web (as a `.zip` file) [from GitHub](https://github.com/juho05/crossonic/releases).
Rename it to `crossonic-web.zip` and place it into the current directory (next to `docker-compose.yml`).

Now extract `crossonic-web.zip` into the just created `./frontend` directory:

```bash
unzip crossonic-web.zip -d ./frontend
```

The last step is to mount this directory as a Docker volume and telling crossonic-server where to look for the frontend files by adding two lines to
your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```diff lang="yaml"
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  crossonic:
    # ...
    environment:
      # ...
      # make sure you do NOT put a . before the /
+      FRONTEND_DIR: "/frontend"
    volumes:
      # ...
+      "./frontend:/frontend:ro"
    # ...
```

Now just restart the container and you should be able to use Crossonic Web by navigating to the URL of crossonic-server in a web browser.

```bash
sudo docker compose up -d crossonic
```
