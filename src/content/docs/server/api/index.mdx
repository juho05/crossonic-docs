title: API Overview
---

The crossonic API is based on the [OpenSubsonic spec](https://opensubsonic.netlify.app/).

In addition to the standard OpenSubsonic endpoints *crossonic-server* serves custom endpoints at the `/rest/crossonic/` subroute.
These endpoints provide extra features that are used by the [Crossonic](/app) app. For some OpenSubsonic endpoints *crossonic-server*
accepts additional parameters or returns additional response fields.
