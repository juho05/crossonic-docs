title: Tips for your music library
---

Although crossonic-server is designed to work with differently organized media directories I recommend following some basic strategies
to improve your experience.

## Directory structure

The directory structure of you media library is mostly irrelevant for crossonic-server. It's only important for cover images to be associated
with the correct album/artist.

I recommend only storing songs from the same album in one directory as well as taking note of the cover art detection described in [Cover art](#cover-art).

## Tagging your music

Because crossonic-server operates on tags and not directory structure it's important to tag your files properly for best results.

### Important tags

Tags are text values in the metadata of your music files that tell crossonic-server (and other music software) information about the music they contain.

These are the most important tags that are *required* if you want your music to be properly organized:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `TITLE` | The name of the song. |
| `ALBUM` | The name of the album. |
| `ARTIST` | The name of the artist. Create multiple `ARTIST` tags if the song has multiple artists. |

See [here](/server/supported-tags) for a full list of supported tags.

### Automated tagging

I recommend using tools like [MusicBrainz Picard](https://picard.musicbrainz.org/) to automatically and properly tag your media files.

It automatically tags your music with MusicBrainz IDs, multiple artists, release types, genres, release date, bpm and much more.

### Replay gain

Different media files can have vastly different volume levels. Crossonic-Server supports [ReplayGain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReplayGain) tags
to tell clients how loud a song should be played back in order for all songs/albums to be equally loud.

These values are not calculated automatically. You'll need to use third-party tools (e.g. [rsgain](https://github.com/complexlogic/rsgain)) to calculate
the replay gain values and write the appropriate tags into your media files.

### Lyrics

Crossonic-Server currently only reads unsynced lyrics from the `LYRICS` or `UNSYNCEDLYRICS` tag and does not support sidecar files.

To automatically populate these tags you can use tools like [MediaHuman Lyrics Finder](https://www.mediahuman.com/lyrics-finder/).

## Cover art

**Album covers** are detected if they are *in the same directory* as at least one song of the album and are named `front.<ext>`, `folder.<ext>` or `cover.<ext>` (case-insensitive)
where `<ext>` is an appropriate extension for either JPEGs or PNGs. The first file in this list being found is used as the album cover.

If no such cover file is found the cover is extracted from the media file if available.

**Artist images** are detected if they are named `artist.<ext>` (case-insensitive) where `<ext>` is an appropriate extension for either JPEGs or PNGs.
If one such file is found all artists whose name matches the parent directory name EXACTLY (case-sensitive including all special characters etc.) are given
this image as their artist image.

If no artist image file is available for a given artist their image is fetched automatically from last.fm if [last.fm integration](/server/configuration/lastfm) is configured.
