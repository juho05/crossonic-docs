Crossonic-Server is a Subsonic-compatible music server with the aim to support modern features of the [OpenSubsonic API](https://opensubsonic.netlify.app/) and custom extensions
for use with the [Crossonic client application](/app).

It works by scanning a directory containing your music files and making your music library available to [Crossonic](/app)
and all other (Open)Subsonic compatible [clients](/server/clients), that can be used to browse
and stream your music on all your devices similar to popular streaming services.

Notable features include:
- Robust library scanning
  - Takes MusicBrainz IDs into account
  - Stores crossonic song ID in the file metadata to prevent losing favorites/scrobbles when renaming files and/or changing metadata
  - Multiple artists/genres per song
  - Release groups, labels, disc subtitles, replay gain, lyrics, bpm, …
  - Incremental scanning (only scans files that have changed)
- Multi-user
  - Each with their own playlists, scrobbles, favorites, …
  - Add internet radio stations per user
- ListenBrainz integration
  - Scrobbling
  - Two-way favorites sync
  - Configurable for each user
- Fetch artist images and biographies from [last.fm](https://last.fm)
- On-the-fly transcoding and caching
  - Configurable `format=` and `maxBitRate=` parameters
  - `raw`, `mp3`, `opus`, `vorbis`
- Receive scrobbles from clients (including playback duration)
- Proper handling of different release versions
- Compatible with your favorite (Open)Subsonic clients
