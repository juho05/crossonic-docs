title: Admin CLI
---

Administrative actions are done using the `crossonic-admin` command as there is currently no admin web UI.

First, ensure that you are in the directory of the `docker-compose.yml` file.

There are three ways to use `crossonic-admin`:

1. Enter the Docker container, then execute commands:
```bash
sudo docker compose exec -it crossonic sh
crossonic-admin ...
```
2. As a single command:
```bash
sudo docker compose exec -it crossonic crossonic-admin ...
```

Both methods only work if the `crossonic` container is already running.

All of the following examples assume that you have entered the Docker container as described in **1**.

## User management

The `users` subcommand is used to manage users.

### Create a new user

To create a new user with their own credentials, playlists, scrobbles, favorites, … use the `users create` command:

```bash
# replace <name> with your desired username
crossonic-admin users create <name>
```

You will be prompted for a password.

### List all users

To list all existing users use the `users list` command:

```bash
crossonic-admin users list
```

### Delete a user

To delete a user and all of their playlists, scrobbles, favorites, … use the `users delete` command:

```bash
# replace <name> with the name of the user you want to delete
crossonic-admin users delete <name>
```

## Remove CROSSONIC_ID tags

To remove the crossonic song ID tags from the metadata of your media files use the `remove-crossonic-metadata` subcommand.

```bash
# remove all song ID tags for the current instance from all files in your library
crossonic-admin remove-crossonic-metadata current
# remove all song ID tags for all crossonic-server instances from all files in your library
crossonic-admin remove-crossonic-metadata all

# remove all song ID tags for the current instance from all files in the specified directory
crossonic-admin remove-crossonic-metadata current /path/to/media/dir
# remove all song ID tags for all crossonic-server instances from all files in the specified directory
crossonic-admin remove-crossonic-metadata all /path/to/media/dir
```

## Miscellaneous

### Generate encryption key

To generate a valid encryption key for the configuration use the `gen-encryption-key` subcommand.

This command works from anywhere and does NOT require a running `crossonic` container.

```bash
sudo docker run --rm -it --entrypoint crossonic-admin ghcr.io/juho05/crossonic-server gen-encryption-key
```
