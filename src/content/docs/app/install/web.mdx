title: Serve on Web
---

Crossonic is available as a [ZIP of static files](https://github.com/juho05/crossonic/releases/latest).

:::caution[Disclaimer]
Crossonic Web is a limited version of [Crossonic](/app) that runs in a browser. Depending on the browser the performance can be
quite terrible and support for different media formats and transcoded playback varies substantially between browsers.
:::

## Serve using crossonic-server

The recommended approach is to [use crossonic-server to host Crossonic Web](/server/configuration/frontend). This way
Crossonic will be available on the same address as *crossonic-server*.

## Use a web server

Visit the [releases](https://github.com/juho05/crossonic/releases/latest) page, scroll down to *Assets* and download `Crossonic-x.x.x-web.zip`.
Then unzip the file and host the directory with a web server of your choice (e.g. [nginx](https://nginx.org) or [caddy](https://caddyserver.com)).

To prevent issues, ensure that:
- You use TLS if you are not accessing the site via `localhost`
- `/sqlite3.wasm` is served with `Content-Type: application/wasm`
- `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` is set to `same-origin`
- `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` is set to `require-corp` or `credentialless`
