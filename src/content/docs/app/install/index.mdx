title: Install Crossonic
---

Crossonic currently offers release build for the following platforms:

- [Windows](/app/install/windows)
- [macOS](/app/install/macos)
- [Linux](/app/install/linux)
- [Android](/app/install/android)
- [Web](/app/install/web)

iOS builds are not available because I do not have a paid Apple Developer account, although the app does work on
iPhones and iPads if you [build](https://github.com/juho05/crossonic#ios) and sign it yourself.
