Crossonic is available as an [AppImage](https://github.com/juho05/crossonic/releases/latest).

:::note
Crossonic is also available as a `.tar.gz` archive but you'll need to take care of installing dependencies,
integrating the app into your system and updating to a new version yourself.
:::

## Install

Visit the [releases](https://github.com/juho05/crossonic/releases/latest) page, scroll down to *Assets* and download `Crossonic-x.x.x-linux-x86-64.AppImage`.

Next open the file. When prompted to allow execution, allow it. On some systems it's necessary to manually make the file executable, you can do that by entering the following
command in a terminal in the directory of the downloaded file:

```bash
chmod +x ./Crossonic-x.x.x-linux-x86-64.AppImage
```

**Make sure that you change the file name in the above command to the exact name of the file you downloaded.**

When prompted to integrate the AppImage, click *Yes*.

The app will now properly install itself on your system and restart.

## Updating

Starting with version `v0.1.0` the app is able to update itself if it was installed as an AppImage. Simply click *Install* when prompted
that a new version is available.

To manually update to a new version, download the latest AppImage, make it executable and replace the old AppImage file with the new one.

## Uninstall

There is currently no automated uninstaller, but the process is not difficult. Assuming you followed the install instructions to install Crossonic:

<Steps>
1. Fully exit Crossonic if it is running, either by right-clicking on the tray icon and clicking *Exit* or by opening the settings page and clicking *Exit*.
2. Uninstall the AppImage and `.desktop` file from your system:

    ```bash
    rm ~/.local/bin/crossonic
    rm ~/.local/share/applications/org.crossonic.app.desktop
    ```

3. Remove all app data:

    ```bash
    rm -r ~/.local/share/org.crossonic.app
    rm -r ~/.cache/org.crossonic.app
    ```

</Steps>
